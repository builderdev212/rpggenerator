# rpggenerator
A simple text-based RPG generator.

## gen.cpp
This is the generation test at the moment. It will turn a given text file
into a header file with the story built into a functional game.

## The purpose.
My goal with this project is to create a tool that allows users to be able
to use their creative knowledge without having to be *extremly* tech savvy.
An end user would be able to create a story from the text file, or use
someone else's story. Simplicity on the end user is important to me, as it's
what makes a program good.
